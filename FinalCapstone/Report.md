# Living in Osaka, Japan
*Capstone project by Cuong Nguyen*

## Introduction
For the last few years I have been living in the city of Osaka,  one of Japan's most unsung cities, often overshadowed by its neighbor Kyoto and Tokyo. I like living here, and I'm living in a great neighbourhood. Unfortunately I cannot stay here forever: I'm renting a small house, and I have to think about a long-term plan.

So where in this city will I buy a new house?

**My requirement is quite simple:**

*1. I want to keep my lifestyle as before, it should be a neighbourhoods which are similar to my former one. (Tsurumi-ku)*

*2. I want my neighbourhood has variety selection of Vietnamese and Thai restaurants.*

*3. I want my neighbourhood has grocery stores.*

To figure this out I want to compare the various neighbourhoods in Osaka to see how similar they are, and finally figure out if there is a neighbourhood similar to mine where I could also live. I will do this based on the different venues and ammenities available in the direct vicinity of the various neighbourhoods.

## Data
To know more about Osaka I need as much data as possible.
I will utilize neighbourhoodâ€™s information of Osaka, Foursquare information on venue categories, top tips, location data, ratings to tackle this task. 

Neighbourhood information can be accessed through: https://www.post.japanpost.jp/zipcode/dl/roman-zip.html
